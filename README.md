## ✨ Key Differentiators

### 🔐 Compass Platform Integration

Connect Nova to the Compass Platform with a single API key:

**Benefits:**
- 🔄 **Sync** sessions across Desktop, Web, and CLI

**Learn more:** [Compass Agentic Platform](https://www.compassap.ai/)

### 🤖 Multi-Model Support

**Choose your model based on the task:**
- ⚡ **Speed** → Claude Haiku 4.5 or Ollama for quick iterations
- 💪 **Power** → Claude Sonnet 4.5 for balanced performance
- 🧠 **Reasoning** → Claude Opus 4.5 for complex analysis
- 🔧 **Alternatives** → GLM 4.7, Minimax, Kimi, Gemini

Switch models mid-session with `/model` — no restart required.

### 🛠️ Skills & Agents Ecosystem

Nova is fully compatible with the Compass agent ecosystem:

#### Skills System

Reusable, composable AI capabilities:
```
skills/
├── code-review/
│   ├── description: "Comprehensive code review"
│   └── actions: [analyze, suggest, report]
├── refactor/
│   ├── description: "Safe code refactoring"
│   └── actions: [identify, plan, execute]
└── test-gen/
    ├── description: "Generate unit tests"
    └── actions: [scan, generate, validate]
```

> **Note:** For information about the Agent Skills standard, see [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io).


#### Agents Configuration (agents.md)
Define specialized agents for different tasks:

```markdown
---
name: security-audit
description: "Security-focused code analysis agent"
model: sonnet-4-20250514
approval-mode: strict
allowed-tools:
  - FileTools(Read)
  - Bash(git:*)
---

Focus on: OWASP Top 10, dependency vulnerabilities, secret detection
```

#### Subagents System
Spawn specialized agents for complex tasks:

```
❯ /agent security-audit
→ Spawns security-focused subagent with strict approval mode

❯ /agent refactor-expert
→ Spawns refactoring specialist with auto-save checkpoints
```

│  → Audit logs for compliance                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Built-in safeguards:**
- Automatic file backups before every modification
- `/undo` command to rollback changes instantly
- External modification detection prevents overwrites
- Token usage limits to control costs

### 🧠 Deep Codebase Understanding

Nova automatically indexes your project with a **200K token context window** and understands:
- File relationships and dependencies
- Function calls and imports
- Project structure and architecture
- Semantic code patterns for intelligent search

```
❯ nova: "Find all files that handle user authentication"

→ auth.service.ts (primary)
→ jwt-utils.ts (utility)
→ middleware/auth.ts (middleware)
→ tests/auth.spec.ts (tests)
```

### 💬 Natural Conversations

Describe what you want in plain English. Nova handles the implementation with 20+ built-in tools for file operations, shell commands, and git integration.

```
❯ "Refactor the authentication module to use JWT tokens"

→ Analyzes current implementation
→ Creates secure JWT-based auth
→ Updates all dependent files
→ Preserves backward compatibility
```

Your conversation history persists with auto-save, and you can export sessions as Markdown, JSON, or HTML for documentation.

## ⌨️ Slash Commands

Stay in flow with quick commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/model` | Switch models on-the-fly (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) |
| `/commit` | Generate conventional commits from staged changes |
| `/approve` | Toggle between Manual, Auto, and Strict modes |
| `/undo` | Rollback the last file modification |
| `/compact` | Summarize conversation to free up context |
| `/export` | Save conversation as Markdown, JSON, or HTML |
| `/tokens` | View current session token usage |
| `/cost` | Display estimated API costs |
